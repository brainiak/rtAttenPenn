## Process:
We will start with the existing matlab code and incrementally convert portions to python (python can be called from Matlab and vice versa). We will also have a testing framework which will run to compare to an original expected_output generated from the original matlab version. Then continue incrementally converting to python and validating the output for each change.

## Installing on Linux Server
Run ````bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brainiak/rtAttenPenn/master/scripts/install-rtAtten.sh)```

## Running:
Initial Matlab version:
<path_to_matlab>/bin/matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -nodesktop -nojvm -r RealTimePunisherFileProcess

## Data Dirs:
The code expects a data/ directory
- data/input  -- holds necessary input files like the mask
- data/output -- receives output files from the run
  - data/patternsdata* -- initial patterns
- data/expected_output -- the data files that should be generated by a correct run

## Phantom data:
Available on ```spock.pni.princeton.edu```
- images in ```/scratch/amennen/20180301.0301181_rtAttenPenn.0301181_rtAttenPenn``` to ```data/img```
- datafiles in ```/scratch/amennen/subject7``` to ```data```

## Issues
- Add z-scoring [scipy link](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.zscore.html)
- Between runs vs realtime (how do we handle time)
- Parallelize ```highpass.pyx```
- MATLAB to use virtualenv python
- Figure out how to automatically pull in Python changes when running from MATLAB
- Determine functions to pull into BrainIAK (e.g., filters that need to be aware of causality)
- ~~Make highpass.py much faster~~
- ~~Check logistic regularization~~
- ~~Double check gaussian with NTB~~

# Clean up
- Move ```copy_files.py``` and similar to ```scripts```
- Do we need to support ```*.json``` config files?
~~- Move ```ServerMain.py``` and similar to ```bin``` or make command line~~
- ~~Create ```conf``` directory to hold ```*.toml``` copy_files~~
